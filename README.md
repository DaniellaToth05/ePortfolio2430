# ePortfolio ‚Äì Investment Management Application

**This project showcases my ability to modernize legacy systems by replacing Java Swing interfaces with a modern, web-based frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all powered by a Spring Boot backend.**

## Description

Initially developed as a **Java Swing GUI** for a school assignment, the project has been modernized with a clean **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** frontend for an enhanced user experience and includes additional functionalities. Now deployed live on Render.
